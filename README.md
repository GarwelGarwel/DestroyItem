# Destroy Item

Are you sick of having to deal with lots of unneeded items, such as tainted clothes and obsolete weapons? Has your warehouse turned into a junkyard? Are you tired of setting up fires and deterioration dumping grounds?

We have you covered!

**This mod will let you easily destroy unwanted items, and do it in a (more or less) balanced way.**

## Features

- Destroy nearly any sort of item: apparel, weapons, resources, corpses etc. (only chunks and some unusual items are not covered)

- Designate one or multiple items for destruction with Architect > Order > Destroy Item tool. Or just press the relevant key (`X` by default).

- Destruction is done by pawns assigned to hauling and usually takes some time, depending on the item's HP, pawn's melee DPS and general labor speed

- No resources are given back, but there is also no filth. Clean job!

- Most pawns will despise destruction of humanlike corpses (although slightly less so than butchering them) and human embryos.

Be careful with silver, steel, plasteel and other such resources: they have no HP in RimWorld and are destroyed immediately.
